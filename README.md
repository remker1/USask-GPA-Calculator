# 📊 USask GPA Estimator (Unofficial)

USask currently does **not provide** a GPA calculation tool for students, and waiting for an academic advisor's email reply regarding progress reports can be time-consuming. This tool provides a **quick and interactive way** to get a broad overview of your academic standing based on your **unofficial transcript**.

With this app, you can:
- View all your courses in a friendly interface
- See your estimated weighted average grade
- Add temporary future courses to simulate outcomes
- Edit or remove grades manually for real-time estimates

## 🔧 Features

- 📄 Reads from your **unofficial transcript PDF**
- ✅ Ignores transfer (TR) grades and considers **only undergraduate-level courses**
- 🔁 For courses you've retaken or withdrawn from, it uses the **newest grade** available
- 📈 Calculates total credit hours, weighted grade sum, and average grade
- 🖱️ Interactive GUI: double-click to edit grades or add/delete courses
